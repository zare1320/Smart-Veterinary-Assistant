        <p>
          Vaccination is a cornerstone of canine preventive healthcare. It works by inducing active immunity, preparing the body to neutralize pathogens without the animal suffering the initial illness.
        </p>
        <SubSection title="The Challenge: Maternally Derived Antibodies (MDAs)">
          <p>
            Puppies receive temporary immunity from their mother's milk (colostrum). These maternal antibodies, while protective, can interfere with vaccines. This creates a "window of susceptibility" where MDAs are too low to protect from infection but high enough to block a vaccine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The puppy vaccination series is a strategic race against declining MDAs. By giving vaccines every 2-4 weeks, we increase the chance of one being effective as MDAs wane. <strong>This is why the final dose must be given at or after 16 weeks of age.</strong>

         <SubSection title="Lyme Disease">
             <p>A tick-borne bacterial disease causing fever, lameness, and potential kidney failure. Risk is highest in tick-endemic areas. Vaccination is an extra layer of protection and does not replace the need for effective tick control products.</p>
